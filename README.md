# Cryptohopper Automated Trading: 24/7 Crypto Bot, Copy Trading, AI-Powered Strategies

If you're tired of watching crypto charts all night and second-guessing every trade, you're not alone. That's why over 1 million traders have turned to Cryptohopper—a cloud-based trading bot that does the heavy lifting while you sleep, work, or actually enjoy life.

Started back in 2017 by two Dutch brothers (one a web designer, the other a day trader), Cryptohopper has grown into one of the most versatile automated trading platforms around. It's not just about letting a bot click buttons. It's about having an entire ecosystem of tools, strategies, and community insights at your fingertips.

## What Makes Cryptohopper Different?

Here's the thing about crypto trading bots: most of them either oversimplify everything or drown you in complexity. Cryptohopper finds a middle ground that actually works.

The platform connects to major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, KuCoin, and about 13 others through API keys. Your funds never leave the exchange, which means Cryptohopper never touches your money directly. That's a big deal for security.

What sets it apart is the blend of automation and control. You can build strategies from scratch using 130+ technical indicators, buy pre-made strategies from experienced traders in the marketplace, or simply copy successful traders through their Copy Bot feature. It's like having training wheels you can take off whenever you're ready.

## The Features That Actually Matter

### Automatic Trading That Runs 24/7

The core feature is simple: your bot scans markets continuously and executes trades based on rules you set. Whether you're using technical indicators like RSI and MACD, subscribing to trading signals from professionals, or letting AI analyze patterns, the bot works around the clock.

One trader put it well in a review: "I was constantly looking at my phone trying to time trades. Emotions would get in the way and it would sometimes cost money. With Cryptohopper, I create rules for when the bot should buy and sell. Now I wake up to trades that were executed automatically as the price moved overnight."

### Copy Bot: Learn from the Pros

If you're new to crypto or just don't have time to build strategies, the Copy Bot lets you mirror the trades of experienced traders. You browse through a leaderboard showing traders' performance metrics, pick someone whose strategy matches your risk tolerance, and your bot automatically copies their moves.

Prices for Copy Bot subscriptions range from $9.99 to $99.99 per month depending on the trader you follow. It's basically outsourcing your trading decisions to someone with a proven track record.

### Paper Trading: Zero Risk Practice

Before risking real money, you can test strategies with virtual funds on real market data. The paper trading feature is included free with every plan, and you can deposit up to 100k of any cryptocurrency in your simulated account.

This is huge for beginners. You get to see how your bot would perform without the anxiety of actual losses. And for experienced traders, it's perfect for testing new strategies before going live.

### Strategy Designer and Backtesting

For those who want more control, the Strategy Designer uses a drag-and-drop interface to build custom trading algorithms. You combine technical indicators, set buy/sell criteria, and create event-based triggers without writing code.

Then there's backtesting—running your strategy against years of historical data to see how it would've performed. You get detailed metrics like Sharpe ratio, win rate, and maximum drawdown. It's like a time machine for trading ideas.

### AI Trading and Algorithmic Intelligence

The Hero plan includes AI-powered features that analyze multiple strategies, backtest them automatically, and deploy the best-performing one based on current market conditions. The AI adapts as markets change, which is particularly useful during volatile periods.

### Risk Management Tools

Trading bots are only as good as their risk management, and Cryptohopper includes several essential tools:

- **Trailing Stop-Loss**: Automatically adjusts your stop-loss as prices move in your favor, locking in profits
- **Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA)**: Doubles down on positions that went south, lowering your average entry price
- **Take Profit Targets**: Set multiple profit targets to scale out of positions
- **Position Limits**: Control how many simultaneous trades your bot can make

One user noted: "I enjoy working with the trailing stop loss. It gives me peace of mind that I know the hopper will take profit at the moments the prices fall again. Since crypto prices are very volatile, this feature is invaluable."

### Arbitrage and Market Making

For advanced traders, the Hero plan includes arbitrage bots (profiting from price differences across exchanges) and market-making tools (providing liquidity to earn spreads). These features require more capital and understanding but can be profitable in the right conditions.

### Marketplace for Strategies, Signals, and Templates

The Cryptohopper marketplace is where traders buy and sell pre-configured strategies, trading signals, and bot templates. You can browse reviews, see track records, and purchase strategies that match your trading style.

Free strategies exist, though most premium ones cost between $10-50 per month. The advantage is getting strategies built by people who've spent months or years refining them, plus you can modify purchased strategies to fit your needs.

## Pricing Plans: What You Actually Get

Cryptohopper offers four tiers, and understanding the differences is crucial because the features vary significantly.

| Plan | Monthly Price | Annual Price (Save) | Open Positions | Selected Coins | Key Features |
|------|--------------|---------------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|

**Quick Recommendations:**
- New to bots? Start with **Pioneer** (free) to test Copy Bot or use paper trading
- Want automation? **Explorer** ($29/month) unlocks the trading bot with essential features
- Serious trader? **Adventurer** ($69/month) adds arbitrage and faster scanning
- Professional setup? **Hero** ($129/month) gives you the full arsenal including AI and market making

The annual plans offer significant savings—up to $258 per year on the Hero plan. Plus, Cryptohopper often runs promotions offering 20-30% off your first invoice.

### Copy Bot Pricing

Separate from the main subscriptions, Copy Bot allows you to follow individual traders for $9.99 to $99.99 per month depending on the trader's performance and complexity. This is in addition to your main subscription if you're on Explorer or above (Pioneer includes unlimited Copy Bots for free).

## Supported Exchanges

Cryptohopper connects with 17 major exchanges:

Binance, Binance.US, BingX, BitMart, Bitfinex, Bitvavo, Bybit, Coinbase Advanced, Crypto.com, EXMO, HTX, HitBTC, Kraken, KuCoin, OKX, Poloniex, ProBit Global

The integration uses API keys, and Cryptohopper never requests withdrawal rights. You can whitelist IP addresses and enable 2FA for additional security.

## Real User Experiences

Looking through hundreds of reviews, patterns emerge. The positive feedback centers on ease of use, 24/7 automation, and the marketplace of strategies. One trader with over a year of experience noted: "I have been running Cryptohopper with a paid signal and strategy for over one year. And even in the rollercoaster market, I am still up 35% for the year!"

The complaints tend to fall into a few categories:

**Setup Complexity**: While Cryptohopper is more user-friendly than many competitors, there's still a learning curve. Understanding technical indicators, configuring strategies, and fine-tuning settings takes time and effort.

**API Disconnections**: Some users report their API keys disconnecting 2-3 times per week, requiring them to re-enter credentials. This can be frustrating and potentially costly if trades are missed.

**Performance in Bear Markets**: Several reviews mention that bots (especially those using third-party signals) struggle during prolonged downtrends. Free signals in particular get criticized for arriving too late.

**Subscription Costs**: While competitive with alternatives like 3Commas, the monthly fees add up, especially when combined with marketplace strategies and signals.

**Customer Support**: Reviews are mixed—some praise quick, helpful responses; others complain about slow resolution times or unhelpful answers.

The platform holds a 3.5-star average on Trustpilot with over 350 reviews, which is decent for a crypto trading bot but indicates room for improvement.

## Is Cryptohopper Legit or a Scam?

Short answer: Cryptohopper is legitimate and has been operating since 2017 with over a million users worldwide. It's not a scam.

However, legitimacy doesn't guarantee profitability. Trading bots amplify good strategies and amplify bad ones just as effectively. They remove emotion from trading but can't predict market movements or guarantee returns.

Several important points:

1. **Your funds stay on the exchange**: Cryptohopper never holds your money
2. **API keys should never have withdrawal rights**: Set them to trading-only
3. **Past performance doesn't predict future results**: Marketplace strategies that worked last year might fail this year
4. **No guaranteed profits**: Anyone promising guaranteed returns is lying
5. **Bot trading involves substantial risk**: You can lose money, sometimes quickly

The platform itself is a tool—like a power drill. In skilled hands with proper safety precautions, it's useful. In inexperienced hands or used recklessly, it can cause damage.

## Current Promotions and Discounts

Cryptohopper regularly offers promotional codes, though they typically apply only to your first invoice:

- **New user trials**: 3-day free trial automatically starts with the Explorer plan
- **Annual subscription savings**: Save $58-$258 per year by paying annually instead of monthly
- **Seasonal promotions**: Discounts of 20-30% often appear during holidays (Black Friday, summer sales, etc.)
- **Milestone celebrations**: Previous promotions offered 25-30% off when Cryptohopper hit user milestones

Discount codes generally work on Adventurer and Hero subscriptions and must be manually entered at checkout. After your first billing cycle, full pricing applies.

## Who Should Use Cryptohopper?

**Good fit for:**
- Traders who can't monitor markets 24/7
- People interested in copy trading to learn from experienced traders
- Those comfortable with moderate-to-high risk trading
- Traders who want to backtest and refine strategies
- Anyone willing to invest time learning the platform

**Not ideal for:**
- Complete beginners with zero trading knowledge
- People seeking guaranteed profits
- Traders with very small capital (under $100)
- Those unwilling to monitor their bots periodically
- Anyone uncomfortable with cryptocurrency volatility

The platform sits in a sweet spot for intermediate traders who understand basic crypto concepts but want automation. Absolute beginners should start with paper trading and Copy Bot, while advanced traders can leverage the full suite of AI, arbitrage, and custom strategy tools.

## Getting Started: The Basics

1. 👉 [**Sign up for a free Pioneer account**](https://cryptohopper.com) to explore the interface
2. **Connect an exchange** via API keys (start with read-only permissions to test)
3. **Try paper trading** with virtual funds to understand how bots work
4. **Test Copy Bot** following a conservative trader to see real-time decisions
5. **Upgrade to Explorer** when ready to automate with your own funds
6. **Start small** with limited positions and conservative settings
7. **Monitor and adjust** based on performance over weeks, not days

The Config Wizard walks you through initial setup, though expect to spend a few hours really understanding the settings before going live with real money.

## The Bottom Line

Cryptohopper isn't a magic money printer, and anyone selling it as such is misleading you. What it is: a sophisticated, feature-rich trading bot platform that automates crypto trading based on strategies you choose or create.

The strengths are clear—extensive exchange support, marketplace of strategies, AI features, robust backtesting, and both beginner-friendly Copy Bot and advanced customization tools. The 3-day free trial and free Pioneer plan remove barriers to testing.

The weaknesses are equally clear—a learning curve exists, subscriptions add up (especially with marketplace purchases), performance varies based on market conditions and strategy quality, and customer support is inconsistent.

For traders willing to invest time learning the platform, starting conservatively, and accepting the inherent risks of crypto trading, Cryptohopper provides legitimate value. The 24/7 automation alone justifies its existence for many users who've seen manual trading consume their time and energy.

Just remember: the bot is only as good as the strategy you give it. Garbage in, garbage out. Spend time learning, testing with paper trading, and gradually scaling up. And never invest more than you can afford to lose—automated or not, crypto remains volatile and unpredictable.
